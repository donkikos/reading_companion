- What was implemented: Standardized TEI unavailable error message and added /sync coverage to return HTTP 503 when embeddings fail.
- Files changed: ingest.py, tests/test_sync_qdrant.py
- Testing: ruff format ingest.py tests/test_sync_qdrant.py; ruff check .; pytest
- **Learnings for future iterations:** Use RuntimeError from `_tei_embed` to surface TEI outages as HTTP 503 responses in `/sync` tests.
