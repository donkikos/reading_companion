## Codebase Patterns
- Skip EPUB navigation docs like `nav.xhtml` when building sentence streams from the spine.

- What was implemented: Added deterministic sentence stream builder with contiguous IDs and nav skipping; ingestion now uses it and added tests.
- Files changed: ingest.py, main.py, tests/test_sentence_stream.py, prd.json
- Testing: ruff format ingest.py main.py tests/test_sentence_stream.py; ruff check .; pytest
- **Learnings for future iterations:** The EPUB spine includes nav documents that should be excluded from indexing to keep sentences clean.
